### 🚀 About Me
I'm a **Senior Mobile Developer** with over 7 years of experience building **high-performance, scalable applications** for both **Android and iOS**.  
I specialize in **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose,SwiftUI, and Clean Architecture**, with cross-platform expertise using **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM)**.  

I love designing clean, maintainable codebases, optimizing **CI/CD pipelines**, and crafting **secure, user-focused mobile experiences**.  
Currently exploring **Compose Multiplatform**, **Ktor**, and **modern design systems** to push the limits of cross-platform development.
